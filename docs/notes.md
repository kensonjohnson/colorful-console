# Notes

Todos:

- Need to count lines logged
  - This is every new line logged or added to the console.
  - Track how large the console window is, this combined with line count determines if something is on screen
- Need to move cursor around
  - Save current cursor position
  - Move the cursor to given line or point
  - Properly update count of lines logged if needed
  - Move back to stored cursor position when needed
- Make some custom animations
  - Clock in corner of window
  - Banner at top of screen
  - Loading bars that can be repeated and updated
  - Table with dynamic information
